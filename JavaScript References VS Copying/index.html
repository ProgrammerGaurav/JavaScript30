        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.splice()

        // one way


        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players)

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players]

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        const captain = person;
        // captain.age = 19;

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
            age: 19
        });
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const captain3 = {
        //     ...person
        // };
